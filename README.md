# eventful_evert_search 
This code is based on Python 3.5
Use eventful API to search event and save it to csv file
This function handles event search.  
Write the all returned result into csv file named events.csv

It can search the 250 most popular events a day because of api limitation.
You can design the event features you need (based on variable event_features in main()) to export.

    
Thank you.
